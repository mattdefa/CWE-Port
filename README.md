Marine veteran. Cyber disruptor in training.
I’m applying for the U.S. Navy’s Cyber Warfare Engineer (1840) program. This GitHub is a live portfolio of projects that demonstrate my initiative, technical capability, and operational mindset.
Every script here is built with purpose — to defend, disrupt, and dominate in cyberspace.
🔧 Tools include:
Packet sniffers
TCP port scanners
OSINT recon tools
Payload logic
I believe in building tools, not just talking about them.
“Train like you fight. Code like you deploy.”
